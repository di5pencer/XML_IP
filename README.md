# XML_IP
###Host name lookup from MASSCAN XML

Takes an XML file from [MASSCAN] and runs a host name lookup on it using sockets.

Needs work /error handling etc.

Place XML's in the same folder as this script and run script (prefferably with Python 3). A CSV of results
will be output in the same directory. The script can handle multiple
files at the same time.
